# simAbun

The repository **simAbun** is used to replicate the simulation results in Section 5 of Liu et al. (2025). 

It consists of four main R code files.

+ Q1Fig1.R: corresponds to the answer to question 1 and shows the Fig. 1.

- Q2Fig2.R: corresponds to the answer to question 2 and shows the Fig. 2.

* Q34Tab3.R: corresponds to the answer to questions 3 and 4, and presents the Table 3.
  
+ Q34Fig3.R: corresponds to the answer to questions 3 and 4, and shows the Fig. 3.

The fold function consists of three files.

+ Abun_0.1-1.tar.gz: source code used to install the R package Abun.

- function_abun_dt_con.R: code to implement the maximum conditional likelihood (CL) estimates via the EM algorithm.

* function_opt.R: code to implement the maximum CL, empirical likelihood (EL), and PEL estimates via the optimization algorithm.

The fold result contains the simulation results generated by the main R code. The fold Fig1-3Tab3 contains the results of Fig.1, Fig. 2, Table 3, and Fig. 3 in Liu et al. (2025).
