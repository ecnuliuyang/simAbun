# simAbun

The repository *simAbun* is designed to replicate the simulation results presented in Section 5 of Liu et al. (2025). It contains four primary R code files:

- **Q1Fig1.R**: Implements the solution for question 1 and generates Fig. 1 in Liu et al. (2025).
- **Q2Fig2.R**: Implements the solution for question 2 and generates Fig. 2 in Liu et al. (2025).
- **Q34Tab3.R**: Implements the solutions for questions 3 and 4 and generates Table 3 in Liu et al. (2025).
- **Q34Fig3.R**: Implements the solutions for questions 3 and 4 and generates Fig. 3 in Liu et al. (2025).

Additionally, the repository includes a folder containing three key files for the *function* fold:

- **Abun_0.1-1.tar.gz**: Source code used to install the R package *Abun*.
- **function_abun_dt_con.R**: Implements the maximum conditional likelihood (CL) estimates via the EM algorithm.
- **function_opt.R**: Implements the maximum CL, empirical likelihood (EL), and penalized EL estimates using the optimization algorithm.

The *result* folder contains the simulation results generated by the main R code, while the *Fig1-3Tab3* folder holds the results for Fig.s 1--3 and Table 3 in Liu et al. (2025).
